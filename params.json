Who hasn't heaps of unsorted forgotten treasures down that hole ?\r\n\r\nSkwares to the rescue !\r\n\r\n![Organize your bookmarks](http://i.imgur.com/TnoDItN.png)\r\n\r\nAnd oh, it'd pronounced like \"squares\", of course, because your bookmarks are now shown as big square icons ;)\r\n\r\n## What to do ?\r\n\r\nMove the skwares around : group them visually, organize them in a way that makes sense to you. Positions are remembered one session to another. Drop them on another tab to move them in the folders tree. Right-click to edit the tittle or remove the bookmark.\r\n\r\n## You like it ? Make it better !\r\n\r\n* [Post issues](https://github.com/EricViala/Skwares/issues), blames, praises, pieces of advices, wishes ...\r\n* Enroll as a contributor (see TODO.txt)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n[Stable version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skwares/koepapmllfahhfimhhkgfihkjgkndiog?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) in Google Chrome Webstore.\r\n\r\nTo run from this GitHub repo, you'll need to grab your own copy of jQuery, jQuery UI and jquery-context-menu and put all the things where they belong, see INSTALL.md\r\n\r\n# Help appreciated\r\nAs of march 28th 2016, Skwares is usable. However, I'm new to both browser extensions and to GitHub, so any help will be greatly appreciated.",
